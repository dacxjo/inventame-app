## Description
Invéntame improves the inventory creation and digitization experience for managers of
small traditional businesses with little computer experience. Our main feature is ease of use thanks to a friendly
and intelligent design based on Material Design. The features of this version include a scanner for codes, 
basic operations for inventory management (adding, deleting, and modifying products), employee management,
searching and communicating with a database, and a mock payment terminal for SoftPOS transactions.


## Features
1. User registration and authentication: Open an account and register your employees to your digital business.
2. Employee managment: Add, edit, erase and search employees of your digital workplace.
3. Product inventory: Add, edit, erase and search products of your digital inventory.
4. Reminder dashboard: Automatic reminders for expiration and low stock.
5. General: statistics concerning top products, total sales, employees and sales.
6. SoftPOS terminal (Mock): turn your phone into a Point of Sale (POS) to open and close sales.

## Dependencies
invéntame was built using Java and the Android SDK, with Firebase as the backend service. It includes
a variety of support libraries such as Picasso for image processing, and ZXing for bar code processing.
